            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a thing well known to them of <hi>New-England</hi> (and too well known amongſt our ſelves) in what excentrick motions the judgements of ſome of the Elders and Churches there have of late been carried about matters pertaining to Church-Adminiſtrations; yet hitherto, for the moſt part, they do concur in their practiſe, though not all acted upon the ſame principles, nor regulated in all things by the ſame Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique and individual Rule. For the practiſe of ſome is <hi>directly</hi> upon particular Rules of Scripture, by them apprehended and acknowledged: The practiſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (to whom the former Rules ſeem miſapplied) is upon more general Rules of Scripture (<hi>viz.</hi> Rules of Charity and Chriſtian Peace) which do by <hi>conſequence</hi> only, and not directly lead them to an Identity and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity in their practiſe with the reſt of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. A general Rule may very well ſuperſede a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; it is a maxime planted in the nature of things, which do often act contrary to the Rule of their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular nature, for the conſervation of the univerſe: and were we as well grounded upon it as our Brethren of <hi>New-England</hi> be, we ſhould both the more prefer the Peace and Tranquility of this Church (which is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good) above our own private Intereſt, and the leſs cenſure them, who upon the ſame principle have
<pb facs="tcp:113862:3"/>ſomtimes taken (and will doubtleſs have the wiſdom always to take) juſt Animadverſion upon them that cauſe Diviſions and are diſturbers of the Churches Peace, though <hi>they</hi> may haply plead their Conſcience, and transform themſelves into Angels of <hi>Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for this Reverend Author, who (amongſt others) is not ſatisfied touching the Charter of the Churches where he lives, and cannot yet finde in Scripture that the Lord Jeſus did ever give them Commiſsion to the <hi>full</hi> exerciſe of that Government which is there Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; he did after long ſilence, at length acquaint his People, and the Reverend Presbyters of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey with his doubtings concerning the way they went in: And upon conference had with them about the particulars controverted betwixt them, finding himſelf ſtill unſatisfied both in their Arguments againſt him, and Anſwers to him (in neither of which he could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſo much truth, as might convince him of Error, or move him from his own principles) but perceiving ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that jealouſies and miſunderſtandings of him did ariſe in the hearts of his Reverend fellow-Presbyters (whoſe love he did always eſtimate at a high rate) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he might the more freely and fully, and at once declare what are the points he holds, and wherein he can or cannot concur with them, and the Reaſons why, he hath drawn up and publiſhed theſe ſhort notes; in the mean time reſolving that love ſhall ſet bounds to
<pb facs="tcp:113862:3"/>his enquiry after truth, and not under pretence of ſeeking truth to tranſgreſs the Rule and Law of love, according to the Apoſtles direction, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.15. Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth in Love.<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>In all this Treatiſe it will be evident at firſt ſight that he is altogether free from a Spirit of Faction, ſeeking only truth and ſatisfaction; and therefore he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly and impartially laid down his Judgement, which is in ſome things coincident with the judgment of the Reverend Presbyters in <hi>New-England:</hi> in ſome things conſenting with our Reverend Aſſembly here in <hi>England,</hi> and in ſome things diſtant from them both; being neither for <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> nor for <hi>Plato,</hi> but for Truth; neither for <hi>Paul</hi> nor for <hi>Apollo,</hi> but for Chriſt.</p>
            <p>In his Stile he does affect to make his words and his matter commenſurable: for the Kingdom of God is not in word but in power.

Thus a King, though abſent from his Kingdom, is a viſible King in his Kingdom. The King of <hi>England</hi> is viſibly King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> though he makes his abode and keeps his Court in <hi>London.</hi> 5. The Church of the Jews was a type and patern of the Chriſtian Church, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40.41, 42. <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.1, 2. compared with <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. The Church of the Jews conſiſted of many Tribes and many Cities, yet was but one Body politick.

That covenant which converts then made, ſeemeth to be general with reference to all Churches. Thus then the Church Militant is one viſible Body, one Houſe, one Family, one Tabernacle, one Temple, one Candleſtick, one Citie, one <hi>New Jeruſalem, Rev.</hi> 21. this <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> hath twelve gates, and theſe gates are particular Churches, which do admit into the whole City, as well as into the particular gates: every gate is an entry into the city, and all in the city have a virtual admiſſion tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row every gate. Every Common-wealth hath power offenſive ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily for the defending of it ſelf, or any other in caſe of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. <hi>Abraham</hi> had power to reſcue <hi>Lot;</hi> but this power is not equal to the power of Churches.

The Churches do approve of each others acts by mutual conſent, when one Church admitteth mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, electeth Officers, diſpenſeth Cenſures, it acts for all Churches.

In the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament it is uſual to ſpeak of a covenant of converſion and reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but neither in the Old or New, can we finde an explicite cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of conſtitution of Churches and admiſſion of members. A people profeſſing faith &amp; a reſolution to embrace the Ordinances of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt together, is a Church before there be any explicite cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting together, &amp; there is an implicite covenant in ſuch a profeſſion.<note place="margin">Pro. <hi>2.</hi>

               <p>When a company of Chriſtians are called to dwell together where there is no foundation of a Church, there is need of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite conjunction or conſent. Such are to make known their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire

And where Elders of ſome neighbouring Church may be procured, it is meet to requeſt aſſiſtance for exhortation together with prayer and bleſſing, as alſo for the ſatisfaction of other Churches concerning the faith and order of ſuch a Church. But for a Faſt of conſtitution, for a concourſe of Churches and their meſſengers, and ſolemnities in way of covenant unto the rearing of particular Churches, I finde no Apoſtolical direction, or footſtep of primitive practice. A feaſt of dedication may ſeem as ſutable as a faſt for conſtitution. Apoſtles and ſuch like were preſent, and did ſomething in ſeparating the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: but for explicite covenanting <hi>(pro modo &amp; forma)</hi> I finde nothing. Explicite covenanting and ſearching of the conſcience, may be a diſpenſation too violent and compulſory in reſpect of the facility of Gods grace in point of acceptance. The Ordinances of the covenant of grace are ſutable to the grace of the covenant. The Elders of the cities of refuge did not expoſtulate with ſuch as fled before the avenger of blood, in way of any explicite covenant or exquiſite examination, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 20. The Eunuch did not promiſe by any covenant explicite what he would be; he onely ſhewed what he did believe, or what he was. Exceſſe of complements in ſolemnities, formalities, punctualities, is unſutable to the ſimplicity and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of the Goſpel, and alſo fully forbidden in the ſecond command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Calvin</hi> in his commentary on <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.3, 4. maketh Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a ſufficient teſtimony that a man is received of God. <hi>When thou ſeeſt a man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>illuminated with the knowledge of God, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis teſtimonii habes quod a Deo aſſumptus ſit.</hi> And he addeth that we ought to hope well of any one <hi>in quo cernimus aliquid Dei.</hi> Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Faith have been deemed ſufficient for mutual communion of Churches, either by writing or word of mouth.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:113862:10"/>hath power both offenſive and defenſive within it ſelf. Thoſe churches <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. had no proper Officers when they were called churches; and there is no intimation that their Officers made them churches.

The church hath relation of a Spouſe unto Chriſt; and it is meet that the Spouſe ſhould have power ſome way or other, in abſence of the Husband. 5. The church hath power to give the Keys, therefore it hath power to act the Keys. 6.

The Officers have no conſtant and ordinary mean of calling, but from the church and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of members; they do not receive their Office immediately from Chriſt, and they cannot receive it immediately always from other Elders. The power of Officers is dependent on the church, not the power of the church on the Officers. The church is greater then its Officers in reſpect of priority, fontality, finality, ſtability and dignity. Maſter <hi>Parker</hi> hath abundantly demonſtrated this aſſertion in his Eccleſiaſtical Policie, and that from principles maintained by <hi>Gerſon</hi> a Papiſt. 3. It was a continued cuſtome from the Apoſtles days, that the people did elect their Officers, <hi>&amp; conſuetudo est bona juris interpres. Calvin</hi> hath demonſtrated this point from <hi>Cyprian.

                  <hi>Beza</hi> for an implicite conſent. The electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the people gives the Keys (at leaſt incompleatly) when they have Elders, becauſe their conſent is neceſſary together with the conſent of the Elders. The Elders have naturally a negative voice in point of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but they cannot compleatly elect any Officer without the conſent of the people. That act which doth give authority, is an act of authority: the peoples conſent in election doth give authority. The aſſumption is thus proved: That which doth compleat the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113862:11"/>act of the Elders, or which doth adde authority to the Elders act, that act doth give authority: but the conſent of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple doth (at leaſt) compleat the act, or adde authority to the act of the Elders in election. 5. Either Election or Ordination alone, or both together, do give the Keys, not Ordination alone; therefore Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction doth give the Keys, either <hi>in toto</hi> or <hi>ex parte.</hi> In <hi>Rome</hi> it was wont to be ſaid that <hi>authoritas</hi> was in <hi>Magiſtratu, Poteſtas in plebe, Majeſtas in populo.</hi> 6. Ordination doth not give the Keys eſſentially, therefore Election doth give the Keys. 1. It appears from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Ordination. Ordination is but a ſolemn declaration and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of a perſon in Office. <hi>Ordinatio est teſtificatio &amp; comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum electionis.</hi> 2. The body of members gave the Keys eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to their proper Officers in the reſurrection and reſtitution of the church out of Antichriſtianiſm. There is no ſufficient teſtimony of their immediate call; and the church of <hi>Rome</hi> had loſt its power. 3. Election is not onely a ſigne of Office; then an officer ſhould be an officer before he be elected, and before he be ordained alſo, becauſe Ordination was wont to follow Election. 4. The Prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites were eſſentially Officers before they were ordained: Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was but a circumſtance to the hereditary right of the Levitical tribe. 5. The fathers and maſters of families were Prieſts before the Law eſſentially and abſolutely, without any Ordination. The cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Ordination under the Law is abrogated, and Ordination un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel is onely moral, and a complement of Election. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Ames</hi> compareth Ordination to the coronation of Princes and inauguration of Magiſtrates, in his <hi>Bellar. Ener.</hi> 6. Election in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Societies doth give the authority. The gift of edification, facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or aptitude is preſuppoſed to Election, the authority or Office is conferred by Election; by Election <hi>ſufficienter,</hi> by Ordination <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danter.</hi> Reformed churches have attributed liberty to the people in point of Election, for the general. <hi>Polanus</hi> ſaith that an Elder is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in the name of the church.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Such an act of ſubjection tranſmitteth that power which the church had formerly within it ſelf, unto the Officers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore giveth authority unto the Officers. Every one that is <hi>ſui juris,</hi> or ſo far as any one is <hi>ſui juri,</hi> he is ſo far indued with authority with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf, and therefore a ſervant giveth authority to his maſter; a ſervant (I ſay) giveth a maſter authority over himſelf, by putting

An Elder elect is ſuppoſed fitteſt to preach and pray for preparation unto his own ordination. 2.

Such as have been ſent in way of ſpecial office, have been onely found to ſend others in point of Ordination, both in the old and new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. The Fathers have obſerved it ſo Religiouſly, as to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate Ordination to the Biſhop.

The church of common members have not formally and actually power to adminiſter the Seals, but it hath power efficiently and virtually.

                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:113862:14"/>were disjunctive in this place, and the meaning of the Apoſtle this: Some Paſtors, ſome Teachers.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth one from the other in reſpect of gifts, but not in reſpect of Offices. 1. The Apoſtles project ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the face of the Text, is to ſpeak of the diſtinct gifts of Officers in way of compariſon, not of the diſtinct Offices of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, or of Officers as comparatively diſtinguiſhed in gifts, not as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed in Office, or of the Offices of Officers in a large ſenſe, as they ſignified gifts, not diſtinct Offices in propriety of ſpeech. Thus Elders were to attend on their Office in exerciſing chiefly, or eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in exerciſing their ſpecial gifts. I ſuppoſe the Apoſtle uſeth <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Object.</hi> The Apoſtle compareth the members of the Church to the members of the natural body; and their gifts to the offices of the members of the natural body. Now diſtinct gifts in mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the natural body, do denote diſtinct members; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the diſtinct gifts of the Officers in a Church (according to the Apoſtle) muſt conſtitute or denote diſtinct Officers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Similies do not neceſſarily run on all four: ſome things ſerve for ornament as well as for argument, as <hi>Maldonate</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth upon the Parables of our Saviour. 2. The Apoſtle compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the gradual difference of gifts in officers, to the ſpecifick diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of offices in the natural body. 1. This is evident from the like compariſon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. Common members have the ſame offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and yet (according to the Apoſtle) they are compared to the members of the natural body in reſpect of their gifts. The compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative diſtinction of gifts in common members, doth not make mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers diſtinct officers. All members of the Church (in the Apoſtles compariſon) have gifts, and comparatively or gradually diſtinct; but all members are not officers. 2. Is it likely that the Apoſtle ſhould ſpeak here onely of a body of officers? 3. It is certain that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of a body of members in common: <hi>We are all members</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>one of another,</hi> verſ. 5. as all, even ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate members are members in the natural body. In the Apoſtles ſenſe therefore members and officers in the Church are different in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſpiritual gifts, onely as the right hand is different from the left; which by reaſon of uſe or conſtitution, is more active and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then the other. Thus one eye may differ from the other in reſpect of its viſive power. gradually, and yet not be a different member eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially, or in reſpect of its kinde and ſpecies. One Chriſtian is more like to one member in the natural body, then to another, in point of uſe; and yet accommodate to the ſervice of all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in a meaſure. In like manner the ſame officers, or diſtinct per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in one and the ſeme office, may be different in reſpect of gifts gradually, and yet induce with a competent meaſure of all gifts ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their office. 4. It is apparent that in the Primitive nays God did eminently induc ſome with a ſpirit of Government, and compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently with a ſpirit of Prophetic, others with an eminent ſpirit of Prophetic, and a compat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:113862:15"/>was to exerciſe that chiefly which was chiefly beſtowed on him. 5. It is ſomething that the Apoſtle putteth down theſe gifts promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly, the diſtributer before the ruler. The Apoſtle is wont to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve order, when he ſpeaks of offices or officers. So <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Some Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Evangelists,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Some Apoſtles, then Prophets, then Doctors or Evangelists, then miracles, then gifts of healing.</hi> Theſe are extraordinary and tranſient members of the Church, and therefore the Apoſtle nameth them in the firſt place, and then proceedeth to the ordinary or permanent; helps in the way of Prophecie or Doctrine. I interpret helps by gifts of Prophecie, becauſe there is ſome correſpondence between this ſecond inſtance in v. 28, and the firſt, in v. 8. Prophecie and Tongues are put laſt, becauſe they were ordinary in reſpect of uſe and continuance in the ordinary officers of the Church. 6. It is apparent by the ſcope of the Apoſtle in the whole Chapter, that he doth ſpeak of the gifts of members and officers conjoyntly, and not onely of the diſtinct and compleat Miniſtrations, or gifts of officers, or of the diſtinct or compleat offices of members. The Apoſtle firſt inſtructeth the Church how to exerciſe gifts in general; then he cometh to gifts in particular; and firſt inſtructeth the Church how to uſe ſpecial or eminent gifts of edification (as the gift of teaching and exhorting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) Laſtly, he deſcendeth to common gifts, love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When the Apoſtle therefore ſaith, <hi>He that teacheth, in teaching;</hi> it is no more then to ſay, He that teacheth, or he that hath a ſpecial gift to teach, and is in office, let him eſpecially attend upon the exerciſe of that gift of teaching. 7. The Apoſtle doth not ſay here or elſewhere, He that is a teacher, or he that is an exhorter, or he that hath the office of teaching or exhorting. Paſtors are diſtinguiſhed from Teachers by the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. not becauſe Paſtors do ſignifie exhorters there; but ſuch as do govern, according to the ſpecial uſe of the phraſe in Scripture: and ſo they are not there compleat titles of diſtinct offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, but conjoyned to the conſtituting of one and the ſame kinde of office. 8. It is certain by what hath been already diſcourſed in the arguments, that exhorting and teaching are not compleat miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of diſtinct officers. Diſtinct offices require diſtinct and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per miniſtrations; not onely ſpecial attendance upon the exerciſe of ſpecial gifts. Teachers are not ſuch as do onely teach, nor exhorters ſuch as do onely exhort, becauſe that every Elder muſt attend both upon teaching and exhorting. An Apoſtle hath ſome proper mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:113862:15"/>to make him an Apoſtle, a Prophet hath ſome proper mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration to make him a Prophet, an Elder hath ſome proper mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration to make him an Elder, a Deacon hath ſome proper miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make him a Deacon. If an Apoſtle may do all that a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet may do, yet a Prophet may not do all that an Apoſtle may do; if an Elder may do all that a Deacon may do, yet a Deacon may not do all that an Elder may do: But a Teacher ought to do all that an Exhorter doth, and an Exhorter all that a Teacher, put aſide the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial improvement of their ſpecial gifts; and in caſe they are all alike gifted, they may every way be equally employed. 9. It is evident that the Deacons are here diſtinguiſhed by gifts onely; he that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributeth is not a diſtinct officer from him that ſheweth mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth him that diſtributeth, from him that ſheweth mercy, becauſe it is the diſtinct office of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows to ſhew mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It belongeth to the Deacons office to ſhew mercy, elſe the Apoſtle would not ſay (he) that ſheweth mercy, but ſhe that ſheweth mercy. 2. Widows are not to be found in all Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; there the Deacons muſt ſhew mercy by themſelves or others,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.16.</note> by men or women as cauſe ſhall require. 3. Widows are not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct officers, but ſubſervient inſtruments to the Deacons office; not ſet officers, but occaſional objects, as well as inſtruments of the Deacons; as the poverty of the widows ſubjecteth them to the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons ſpecial providence. For concluſion, it may appear by what hath been ſaid, that teaching is but an incompleat miniſtration or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of an Elder; and ſo exhortation, a gift to teach, and a gift to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bort, are both neceſſary for every Elder.</p>

This is an argument, that it is not onely the office of ſome to govern, and the ſpecial office of others to teach, but that it is the office of thoſe which teach, equally to attend upon government in point of office, with thoſe which are ſuppoſed to be onely for government. This being ſuppoſed, ruling Elders ſeem to have little or nothing to do — <hi>veritas non parit abſurda.</hi> The teaching Elders are moſt meet to act in publique ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations; in private adminiſtrations the Deacons were wont in ancient times to do what ruling Elders are ſuppoſed to ſerve for. 4 Elders are equally honoured in all ſalutations, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. The Apoſtle putteth a diſtinction between Biſhops and Deacons, none between Biſhops and ruling Elders. Teachers are eminently more honourable, in reſpect both of adminiſtrations and qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for they onely are intruſted with the Tables and Seals of the Covenant, and they onely are endued with knowledge and wiſdom in reference to teaching; perſons thus unequal, do not deſerve equal honour.

All the officers of the Church (in all likely hood) are there diſcourſed of, and yet the Apoſtle requires the ſame qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without any diſtinction in all the Elders of the Church. 7. Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Elders ſeem to have nothing to do, but that which Deacons did in Primitive times. The Deacons were wont (as is ſuppoſed by good Antiquaries) to be part of the Presbyterie. According to <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cypr. lib. <hi>3.</hi> ep. <hi>10.</hi> &amp; l. <hi>3.</hi> ep. <hi>15.</hi>
                  </note> they did <hi>praeceptis gubernare, &amp; manus imponere.</hi> Under the Ceremonial law, all the Church officers were Prieſts and Levits, and doubtleſſe the Jewiſh church was an accorate type and pattern of the Chriſtian. This may ſerve for an eighth Argument. The Levirs were to excel in power and dignity, for they were choſen in place of the firſt born: And the Deacons were to be full of the holy Ghoſt and wiſdom. <hi>Act.</hi> 6. In <hi>Moſes</hi> time ſome Levites did bear the Arke, the Table, the Altar, ſome the Tabernacle, the Tent or Covering, ſome the boards and pillars, <hi>&amp;c.

We are to attend on the Word and Prayer (ſaith the Apoſtle.)

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, It is not neceſſary to interpret governments in this Text, by diſtinct officers in point of government, becauſe it is the intent of the Apoſtle to ſpeak here of the members of the Church as endued with diſtinct gifts, as well as of diſtinct officers. This is oppoſite to his preceding diſcourſe concerning the members of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural body, and alſo to his ſcope in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. as hath been already declared. All diſtinct gifts of members do not conſtitute ſo many officers, for then all members in the Church may be officers. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry member endued with a gift is an helper, but not an Officer; an officer is not endued with one gift alone, but with many together. 2. Miracles, healings, tongues, interpretation of tongues, do not import ſo many officers, and therefore it is not neceſſary (govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) ſhould conſtitute a diſtinct office. The Apoſtle indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanceth in ſome officers, officers being eminent members of the Church in reſpect of their gifts: but his drift is directly to ſpeak of members as endued with gifts, not onely of members that are offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and therefore mentioneth members eminent in gifts together with members that were eminent in office. 3. The Apoſtle doth not ſay governours, but governments; which intimateth that he rather ſpake of gifts then of officers. 4. Helps and governments ſeem here to ſignifie the ordinary teaching Elders, if any ordinary officers do anſwer to the gift of Prophecie and the gift of diſcerning ſpirits, <hi>v.</hi> 10. both which are neceſſary to an Elder; the one for teaching, the other for governing. If wiſdom be the eminent gift of Apoſtles, knowledge of Prophets, faith or the word of faith, the eminent gift of Evangeliſts, then the particular inſtances in <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do

This ſeemeth to be the ſenſe of the text: The Elders that rule well, that is, which are eſpecially gifted for government, and which eſpecially attend on that gift, eſpecially
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:113862:18"/>ſuch as labour in the word <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (that is) ſuch as are eſpecially gifted for doctrine, and ſo eſpecially attend on that gift, are worthy of double honour. I take this to be the moſt genuine interpretation. <hi>Barnabas</hi> was faithful in his miniſtery, yet <hi>Paul</hi> was the chief ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. 4. It is not imaginable how ruling Elders ſhould deſerve ſuch equal honour with teaching Elders. Teaching Elders muſt diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attend government as well as doctrine. 5. Such as rule well are not ſuch as rule onely, becauſe ſuch as labour in the Word are not ſuch as labour onely in the Word, but ſuch as labour chiefly in the Word. It is queſtionleſſe that the Teachers muſt labour in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as well as in doctrine. 6. If the Apoſtle had meant ſuch as rule onely, it had been moſt plain to have ſpoken after this manner, The Elders that rule well are worthy of double honour, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe that rule well, and labour in the Word and Doctrine alſo. 7. The Apoſtle in the ſame Epiſtle 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. and elſewhere, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth a gift or ſpecial aptitude to teach in all Elders. 8. This Text is ſomewhat paralel to <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. from which we may more eaſily learn the mind of the Apoſtle in this place; It is the idiome of the Apoſtle to ſpeak of members as gifted in thoſe Epiſtles. The members of the natural body do moſt exquiſitely hold forth the gifts, faculties, or natural offices of Church-members, whether in office, or out of office, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8. The Apoſtle reckoneth up nine ſeveral gifts, but not to point out nine kinds of officers in the Churches. He that propheſieth onely, is not a diſtinct officer; he that diſcerneth ſpirits onely, is not a diſtinct officer; he that ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth tongues onely, is not a diſtinct officer: ſo he that teacheth, he that exhorteth, he that ruleth, theſe adminiſtrations do not adaequately or completely deſcribe ſo many diſtinct Elders in point of office, all theſe gifts are neceſſary to every Elder. <hi>In Cant.</hi> 4. &amp; 6. &amp; 7. The Church is deſcribed, circumſcribed by her feet, thighes, belly, breaſts, neck, lips, teeth, noſe, eyes, and by the temples of her head, but all theſe members of the Church, endued with ſundry and ſeveral gifts, do not beſpeak ſo many diſtinct Officers in the Church. The head of the Church, or of the Spouſe, ſeemeth to repreſent Chriſt in the Presbyterie; her hair, the doctrines and profeſſion of the Presbyters, hanging, adhereing as hair to and upon the head; her eyes, noſe, teeth, lips, and neck, their gifts of wiſedom, knowledge, and diſcerning, or of teaching, and exhorting, and governing. The Presbyterie is like mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> becauſe it is fruitful; the hair is like purple, and like
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:113862:18"/>a flock of Goats on mount <hi>Gilead,</hi> becauſe the doctrine and profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the miniſters of Chriſt clothe both themſelves and others with the garments of ſalvation; The temples within the locks are the gracious and inward qualifications, like to pomegranates for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſſe both to the eye and taſt.</p>
               <p>This Presbyterie hath eyes, and teeth, and lips; to teach, exhort; it hath a neck like an Armory, a noſe like the Tower of <hi>Libanon,</hi> that looketh towards <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> theſe ſignifie the gifts of government, whereby the Church is defended againſt its enemies both within and without; the enemy of Iſrael was <hi>Damaſcus</hi> eſpecially, and therefore the Spirit of God chuſeth it to point out the enemies of the Chriſtian Church. This may ſuffice for to illuſtrate the diſcourſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle concerning the gifts and members of the Church. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>

Elders are the onely ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing teachers in the Church, in point of ordinary execution. 1. Thoſe in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 are called Prophets, and their adminiſtration is called prophecying, this arguoth an eminency of gift both in reſpect of the matter of it, and alſo in reſpect of the manner of coming by it. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie when it is taken properly, notes an eminent adminiſtration, and that from ſpecial inſpiration throughout all the Scripture. <hi>Aſaph</hi> and <hi>Heman,</hi> and <hi>Jeduthun</hi> &amp;c. are ſaid to propheſie 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. theſe may be ſaid to propheſie figuratively; and yet it is certain that <hi>Aſaph, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and <hi>Jeduthun</hi> were extraordinarily taught by the Spirit of God, and it is probable that their children alſo were eminent under them in this reſpect. The Spirit of God helped them to indite Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Pſalmes, and alſo to perform their other muſical admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations; why elſe was this office ſo tranſcending the other functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the other Levites? <hi>Bezaliel, Samuel, David, Aſaph, Heman, Jeduthun</hi> and their ſons, <hi>Eliſha</hi> and the children of the Prophets, all theſe were ſingularly inſtructed by the Spirit for the ſervice of God, for the work of the Tabernacle and Temple, in doctrinal and muſical adminiſtrations, in vocal and organical muſick: And all theſe were types of the miniſters of the Goſpel,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.20.</note> and of all other which are taught by the Spirit, to make melody in their hearts and in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations unto God. Our <hi>David</hi> hath invented us to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of muſick, we are onely the people that are ordained to ſhew forth the praiſe of our God.

Propheſie is expreſſed to be one of the gifts which were extraordinarily conferred in thoſe times, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3. It was an uſual effect of impoſition of hands. 4. How ſhould ſo many in ſo ſhort a time acquire ſuch ability to ſpeak by ordinary means? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters do generally apprehend thoſe Prophets to be in an eſpecial manner inſpired. The Etymologie in the Greek is known to ſpeak much, the uſe of it in Scripture ſpeaks more. The common-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers may be thought to propheſie as well as Elders 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. becauſe the gift of the Spirit was vouchſafed to Elders and others. 5. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie is made to anſwer to revelation, doctrine to anſwer to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; the latter phraſes do explicate the former, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.6. and the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. maketh mention of the gift of Propheſie, as a ſingular gift of the Spirit in thoſe dayes. 6. All that were ſtanding preachers (according to the Scripture) were ſent of God by ſome ſpecial calling, mediate or immediate, directly or indirectly, expreſly or by good and manifeſt conſequence.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Their gift did excel the common gift, or the gift that was common to all members, as hath been diſcourſed. 2. The gift was miraculous in reſpect of the manner of comming by it; and a like gift in theſe daies being not ſo circumſtantiated, doth not ſo edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; tongues were then of publike uſe in common members, partly becauſe they were miraculouſly conferred; tongues now are not of publike uſe in the Church in common members, when Elders have the ſame. 3. Now there is no reaſon why an inferiour gift ſhould be ordinarily exerciſed by ſuch as are not in ſtate of office; if any ſhould be permitted ordinarily to teach together with the Elder, they are the Deacons, and yet it is not the Deacons office ordinarily to teach in publike. The Elders or Church may intreat ſuch as have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated themſelves to the miniſterie, and others alſo (in ſome caſes) to exerciſe a gift of edification, but not in way of ſtanding office or ordinance; The Elders are called Teachers, becauſe it is their office
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:113862:19"/>to teach ordinarily. The Prieſts did onely blow the Trumpets un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, to denote the Office of the Elders under the Goſpel. The Levites might carry the Ark, the Table, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the Prieſt onely did uncover the Table, the Altar, <hi>&amp;c. Numb.</hi> 10.8. this was to ſhew that the Elders onely have authority to open the Tables of Gods Law, and to reveal the myſteries of the Kingdom of God, in the way of ſtanding Office. It was onely the Prieſts office to take down the tent and tabernacle; and accordingly it is onely the Elders office to preach ordinarily the doctrine of the Goſpel, the doctrine of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and mortification, to make way for the Churches progreſſe in the wilderneſſe.</p>

Magiſtrates have power to teach in the Common-wealth ordinarily, though not as Prophets in the Church.

We affirm that the power of Presbyters doth not eſſentially depend on Ordination, but on Election. The people have power to act, yea, even to adminiſter the Seals virtually and mediately, and give power by Election to the Elders.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:113862:22"/>members hath more authority then the Elders. 2. If the elders and body of members have a negative voice for the binding of each other, then we make the church to conſiſt of two co-ordinate ſocieties, but altogether <hi>gratis,</hi> as far as I underſtand the Scripture. 3. A binding power is a power of authority, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. and 18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. And authority may be natural as well as inſtituted. The people have authority by a natural law originally, the elders by a poſitive law. And if the people have power by a natural or hereditary right in point of ordinary execution, their authority of ordinary execution doth ſo far excel the power of elders, as heriditary Monarchy doth excel that which is elective, and ſo it is in an Ariſtocracy. 4. A ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the members conſent doth conſtitute church-government exceſſively Democratical. In <hi>Rome,</hi> in <hi>Athens</hi> &amp;c. they were far from ſuch a Democracy, as wherein all the people did govern con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly with their Magiſtrates, and yet they are reputed Democrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. An abſolute Monarch (ſaith one) is not bound to a Parliament; and grant but an abſolute Ariſtocracy, a Parliament or general court ſhall have but a conſultative power, not a binding or authoritative power. <hi>Chamier</hi> profeſſeth that he hath not ſeen one that affirmeth church-policie to be Democratical. But if the conſent of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers be abſolutely neceſſary in ordinary execution, certainly church policie is Democratical, or elſe there neither hath been, nor is any Democracy in the world where there are Magiſtrates. Truth is, where Magiſtrates are bound to the judgement of the people in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary execution, they are but titular magiſtrates, and where elders are bound to the judgement of the members, they are but modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors or titular governors. 5.

Allegories are Argumentative, when they are evident. And though all things are not exactly typed out in the ceremonies, at leaſt in all ceremonies, yet it is our duty to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that which is repreſentative. The Prieſts were types of all ſpiritual men in oppoſition to natural men, but they were types al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of Elders in reſpect of their ſpecial office, as they are oppoſed to the Saints in general.</p>

Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> have abundantly proved this point: and Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> alledgeth many places of Scripture to ſhew that church in this place, ſignifieth the Presbyterie: Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> affirmeth, the congregation in the old Teſtament is alwaies taken for the Presbyterie, when it is meant of an authoritative congregation. Our Saviour may well be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to conform his ſpeech to the old Teſtament, rather then to the new Teſtament, to the uſe of the phraſe, at that time when he ſpake, not ſo much to the future uſe of it, in the new Teſtament. 3. Our Saviour doth manifeſtly allude to the Presbyteries of the Jewes, and gives the Chriſtian church a pattern from the practiſe of the Jewiſh church. One would not think that our Saviour ſhould ſpeak of an unknown church, and not deſcribe it, becauſe he directs the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to repair to it: to direct one to a place unknown and unknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, is but labour in vain. Beſides, thoſe phraſes heathen and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, and two or three witneſſes, do argue that our Saviour referred his ſpeech to the Jewiſh church. Two or three witneſſes were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by a State rule in their civil Judicature, and it was grounded upon morality, and therefore to be obſerved in their Eccleſiaſtick proceedings to cenſure. They might not have found out ſuch a rule (though naturally moral) by the reach of natural light: but being inſtructed by Gods Ordinance, they could eaſily diſcern the morality thereof, eſpecially the Prophets and men of God, which were raiſed up continually amongſt them. 4. The church is here explicated in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:113862:26"/>the next words, <hi>What you ſhall bind, ſhall be bound in heaven.</hi> If the church had been taken for the body of members, it ſhould (in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability) have run thus; What it ſhall bind, ſhall be bound in hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. 5. Elſe this rule did nothing concern the Apoſtles, conſidered perſonally: but they were perſonally to practiſe themſelves accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this rule. The Apoſtles were neither to judge together with ſuch a church, nor to be judged by ſuch a church as conſiſted of the body of members. 6. Is it likely that our Saviour ſhould bid a brother repair in the firſt place to the body of members? What do the elders then ſerve for? 6. The promiſe to two or three doth ſomewhat declare what church is here meant. The former words <hi>What you ſhall bind,</hi> &amp;c. ſeem to be referred to the Apoſtles then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: theſe words <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my name,</hi> &amp;c. ſeem to be referred to ordinary elders which were to follow. And theſe two or three elders may juſtly be ſuppoſed to be an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Presbyterie, and they are proportionate to the two or three elders which conſtituted Presbyteries in the leſſer cities of Iſrael. The two or three here intended, are not the ſame with the two or three witneſſes before mentioned. 1. Such a private proceeding doth not conſtantly admit of prayer. 2. Chriſts preſence in the midſt of them, argueth a more ſolemn aſſembly then that of the witneſſes. 3. So ſolemn a promiſe intimateth ſome great difficulty in the act to which it is applyed. 4. Our Saviour hath manifeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to ſuch as did bind and looſe, in the words going before. 5. It is ſpoken in conformity to a church then erected, and to the proceedings then accuſtomed. The intent of the promiſe, argueth a greater latitude then is competible to that particular caſe of convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. I might now charge the multitude of Incerpreters both an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and modern, but it is done already by others. It is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the Synedrion of Elders was called the Congregation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was wont to be an aſſembly of people preſent in the place and at the time of Judicature; we call the Presbyterie the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive church, upon another conſideration.</p>
               <p>A ſecond general anſwer may be this, the church is ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of Elders. and then a Church properly ſo taken, is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired unto immediatly. And our Saviour may lay down the rule ſo, as that it may ſerve for all times and all conditions of the Church.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Women have no judicial power, though the Apoſtle writes to all, therefore other members may not have judicial power, though the Apoſtle writes to all. Such ſpeeches muſt be interpreted <hi>quoad materiam ſubjectam.</hi> And if women (notwithſtanding this place of the Apoſtle) muſt be denied judicial and co-ordinate autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or power, or conſent, becauſe other texts do ſo require; why ſhould not other common members alſo (not withſtanding this place of the Apoſtle) be denied the like authority, power, or conſent, if other texts do require it? If there be any authority in Councels and Synods, then the conſent of the major part of members ſhall not be neceſſary, in many great acts which concern all; becauſe it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for all churches to convene in their particular perſons. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle wrote to the elders as well as to the members. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12 8. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 5.1. 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 1.11. and therefore it is to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that the elders were eſpecially, if not wholy, reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter by the Apoſtle in ſuch inſtructions and commandements. 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 14. All are exhorted to ſee that all things be done decently and in order; but this is eſpecially (if not onely, in point of immediate execution) the elders care and office. Elders are not onely the members orators, or ſuch as we call moderators and prolocutors, to govern the actions and not the perſons of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. <hi>Morellius</hi> his phantaſme (as one calleth it, who writes ſtrongly for the power of members) hath been generally condemned, eſpecially by French churches in their Synods.</p>
               <p>Though common members were not equal agents with the elders in excommunications, and yet the Apoſtle doth not here undertake to declare in what order they ſhould concurr. 2. The church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> was now to obey the Apoſtles ſentence, and did but put the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſentence with due and effectual ſolemnities in execution. The ſpirit of the Apoſtle doth denote his Apoſtolical ſpirit both of dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and correction. To direct with judicial authority, is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand with coactive power. The word (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) argueth more then a doctrinal determination. What ſpirit ſhould be preſent at the inſtant of excommunication, but his ſpirit of Apoſtolical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection or authority? Spirit here is to be interpreted, <hi>quoad ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriam
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:113862:27"/>ſubjectam:</hi> truth is, the Church of Corinth (according to the original) is not made the nominative caſe to the act of delivering up to Sathan, only it is required that it be done when the church is gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together.

                  </note> the church of Corinth <hi>obedientialiter.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> and others do conſent to this aſſertion. 3. It is apparent that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were wont to write ſo much to the whole church, becauſe the common members had ſpecial need to be inſtructed and incited to the performance of their duty, and in particular to the ſubmitting of themſelves to their elders. 4. We grant that the common mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers have ſomething to do in many church acts, and eſpecially in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications; they are to put the ſentence of the elders in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution in declining from the parties cenſured; What the Apoſtle at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes unto the whole church any where, is abundantly exhauſted and ſatisfied in the Churches doing of execution. <hi>Moſes</hi> applieth the phraſe of caſting out or putting away the evil one, to the peoples doing of execution, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.7. See <hi>Ainſworth</hi> on the place. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> frequently applies the act of judging, killing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to all Iſrael though they did what they did chiefly by their Magiſtrates, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.5.9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We do farther grant that the common members have a ſudordinate power of judgement, though not a co-ordinate power. A brother is under a power judicial of the body of members; but the body of members are under the judicial power of the elders them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. The Saints are brought in as judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.3. and they have a judicial power over the ſinful world, but it is ſubordinate, and they muſt judge dependently under Chriſt. The woman is brought in propheſying and praying in the Congregation, but ſhe muſt propheſie and pray in the church by no power formally, but onely by participation. <hi>Joſhua</hi> giveth the ſentence againſt <hi>Achan,</hi> and all Iſrael ſtoneth him with ſtones, and burneth him with fire; thus all Iſrael muſt ſtone and burn the <hi>Achans</hi> of the Church with the judgements of God denounced againſt them in Gods fiery law by the miniſtery.

Lordlike power conſiſteth in Magiſtratical commands, laws, and <hi>mediums</hi> of puniſhment, and in an imperious execution of power. If the <hi>authoritas</hi> be in magiſtrates in reſpect of ordinary execution, he may puniſh the whole Common-wealth one by one, nay altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>(de jure)</hi> in point of ordinary execution (in caſe juſtice requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it.)

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Excommunication is eſſentially caſting out of Church eſtate. 2. A particular Church may be caſt out of the univerſal Church. <hi>Junius</hi> and all ſeem to deny an unity integral or viſible in the univerſal Church, yet they generally allow of a judicial power in Synods and Councells; and how is that poſſible, unleſſe there be an univerſal viſible Church?

                  <hi>Object.</hi> Elders are hereby made inexcommunicable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is more ſutable that Elders, that Governors ſhould be exempted from excommunication (in point of ordinary executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) then thoſe which are governed. 2. The major part of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church is made inexcommunicable wholy, if particular Churches are neither ſubordinate to their Elders, nor to Synods and Councells. 3. We ſuppoſe that Elders of particular Churches are ſubordinate to Synods and Councels, and that the majeſty reſideth principally in the Church univerſal. We ſuppoſe that Elders are ſubordinate to their particular Churches in reſpect of a defenſive power in the way of excommunicating or withdrawing. As El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are ordained by Elders, ſo it is meet that particular Churches ſhould make uſe of Elders in the depoſing and excommunicating of an Elder. 5. We may put a difference between an ordinary and an extraordinary power. A magiſtrate may be ſubordinate to his people
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:113862:28"/>in whom the majeſty doth reſide, in point of extraordinary executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, notwithſtanding he hath power (in point of ordinary execution) to inflict capital puniſhment upon the people: <hi>Poteſtas eſt in Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratu &amp; principe co modo, ſub quo tranſlata est.

Some godly writers have ſeemed to be in amaze when they have ſpoken of the conſent of the members; but what hath been their own practice? Thoſe of Reformed Churches for the general, which have ſpoken moſt fully for the conſent of the people, have excluded it from being co-ordinate with the ſentence of the Elders.

Chriſt and his Miniſters do govern like the ſweet fig tree, the ſat olive, and the true vine, not like the bramble that hath neither ſhadow nor good fruit. It is obſervable how the Church is delineated <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. where the body of members is elegantly diſtinguiſhed from the Elders, as the body from the head. 1. Her ſhoes and feet do denote her heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converſation and patience, eſpecially in the ambulatory courſe of the primitive Church for the converſion of the world, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 16.15. 2. Her thighes, navel, and belly, do repreſent her as the fountain of procreation and converſion. The Church is the mother of all living, The graces of the Spirit are the jewel-like joynts of her thighes. The Church is the font of the world, filled with the liquor of grace, and out of her belly flow rivers of living water unto the regeneration or converſion of the world. Her belly is compared to heaps of wheat, beſet with pleaſant lillies, to ſignifie that Chriſt conveigheth himſelf to the world as the bread of life, by the Church in her womb all the infant converts of the world are nouriſhed unto eternal life. Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem is the mother of us all. 3. She is deſcribed with breaſts, to declare how ſhe nurſeth her new born babes with the milk of the Word. But how, and by whom doth the Church conceive, bring forth, and breed up her children? Her head is indued with variety of gifts, for teaching, diſcerning, and governing; that is the ſeat of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and government, the body is the region of ſubjection. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the key of authority is in God, the key of excellency is in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:113862:29"/>Chriſt; the key of miniſtry is in the Church fundamentally, in the Presbyterie for execution. <hi>A primo omnia, per ordinem omnia, ad finem omnis perfectio, &amp; rerum omnium quies ordo eſt perfectionis ſola &amp; inevitabilis via.</hi>

                  <hi>Iſaacus a Telia.</hi> I underſtand by the keys in the Text, the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial or ſtewardlike power of adminiſtring the word and prayer, the ſeals and cenſures in the Church. Election is an act of eſſential au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, directly and primarily, of derived authority ſecondarily and <hi>conſequenter.</hi> In caſe the Presbyterie doth cenſure the Church by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of derived authority, and the Church the Presbyterie by vertue of eſſential authority, other Churches muſt judge which cauſe is juſt, by the rule of Chriſt in the Word. Presbyters are not ſubject to the common members in cenſures of ſuperiority. In Iſrael the Elders or magiſtrates were primitively elected by a Democratical power, and yet were not ſubject to a Democratical power being once ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. A power in the people to ſet up and depoſe their Magiſtrates in way of authority, conſtituteth a Democracy. The fraternity hath a defenſive power to non-communicate with their Elders, or power of a defenſive excommunication, with reference to their Elders. One Church hath a co-ordinate power of defence,<note place="margin">Jus eſt vel rectorium vel aequato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium.</note> in relation to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Church, not offenſive power. In an Ariſtocracy or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. the people have a defenſive power to repel injury, not an offenſive power.</p>
               <p>The Elders of the Church have power of order to act in all Churches upon the intreaty or conſent either of Elders or the Churches themſelves 1.<note place="margin">Pro. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> It is natural to all bodies to act for their mutual edification. 2. The ſeals and ſuch like adminiſtrations have a common relation, to admit members; to diſpence cenſures, hath a particular relation to a particular Church; but the word and ſeals have a common and general relation to all Churches equally. 3. There is a ſacred-aptitude, though no indeleble Character imprinted on Elders, elſe they are not accomodated to adminiſter holy things, eſpecially ſuch things as are holy by inſtitution. This miniſterial aptitude or fitneſſe, hath relation to holy things in all Churches; there is nothing wanting to execution but orderly permiſſion. 4. The ground of dividing the Church into particular Churches doth war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant this power; We are many Temples or Churches for edification ſake. If there had been many Temples in Judea, what could have hindred the Prieſts from miniſtring (as occaſion required) in any of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:113862:29"/>them? 5. We allow communion of Members, why not of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters? As Miniſters depend on their particular Church for Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to diſpenſe holy things, ſo Members depend on their particular Church for Authority to partake of holy things. As it is a priviledge to partake, ſo it is grounded upon Authority; a Member may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge communion. And it is a priviledge alſo to diſpenſe holy things, though dependent on Authority. 6. The Churches do mutually allow and ratifie one anothers acts: One Church admitteth Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers for all Churches, and one Church electeth Officers for all Churches; one gate of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> admitteth into the whole City, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. One Elder hath a general relation to the univerſal Church, as well as a ſpecial relation to his particular Church. To ſay no more, it is ſufficient that ſuch a power of Elders tendeth to the edification of the Churches, while nothing can be produced <hi>in oppoſitum.</hi> The Apoſtle doth implicitely command us to do all things which are for edification <hi>(confideratis conſiderandus)</hi> when he commandeth us to do all things in ſuch a maner as may be for edification, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. What hath been ſaid for the Unity of the Church, doth ſhew that there is no ataxis or diſorder in this communion of Elders. There was no queſtion in Primitive days concerning the power of Eldere, in reſpect of Ordination, Adminiſtration of the Seals, and Preaching of the Word in all Churches. It is commonly known that <hi>Anicatus</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>Polycarpus</hi> to adminiſter the Sacrament in his Church. See <hi>Magdebar. Centariatores.</hi>

It was not lawful for the Iews to ſhew ſo much reſpect to their clean meats (which yet were holy reſpectively) as to the holy meats of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary.

It is but neceſſary to confine our ſelves to ſome ſet times of Worſhip, as in our families, ſo likewiſe in publike; time is but connatural to Worſhip, a ſet time is but methodical, all the while natural bounds be obſerved: But the deſignation of perpetual times of Worſhip is proper to the Lord. 1.

Thus the Members of the Viſible Church are termed Saints, the called and Elect of God, the ſealed ones, the Heirs of Eternal life; this is frequent with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, &amp; it is uſual alſo for the Apoſtles to apply the promiſes of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance and life unto them.

               <p>THe acts of Magiſtracy are not only civil Laws, Precepts, Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Rewards; but alſo ſpiritual Loves, Precepts, Prayers, Bleſſings, Iuſtructions, Admonitions: Theſe ſpiritual acts do da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate Magiſtratical power to be ſpiritual power, though not Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical. Church power is ſpiritual generically, in reſpect of acts which are ſpiritualin common, but by way of ſpecialty it is ſpiritual, as it is Eccleſiaſtical. Magiſtratical power is both civil and ſpiritual, yet not Eccleſiaſtical; or civil as it is oppoſed to Eccleſiaſtical power, not as oppoſed to Spiritual. 5. The next ends of Magiſtratical acts are Spiritual, and acts are diſtinguiſhed by their ends or immediate objects. The Spiritual good of men is both intended and acquired in Magiſtratical acts, as primarily as the Temporal good of men: A Magiſtrate doth Inſtruct, Pray, &amp;c. to the end he might confer ſome Spiritual good, and the act it ſelf doth as naturally and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly produce ſuch an effect, as if it were the act of an Eccleſiaſtical perſon; and ſuch an act is ſuppoſed to be the act of a Magiſtrate as he is a Magiſtrate, not only as he is a Chriſtian. And if the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate be prophane, and ſhould not intend any Spiritual good (as it was ſaid of one, that he was <hi>bonns Rox,</hi> but <hi>malus homo</hi>) it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that the act it ſelf doth. 2.

As for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation in the Primitive times, that was Inſtituted for the colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpiritual gifts, and it was wont (as firſt) to be adminiſtred preſently after Baptiſm. Sure I am, thoſe cautions of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 11. do not exclude children, becauſe the ſame cautions are to be obſerved by ſuch as are to be Baptized, in caſe they be adulterers. The Apoſtle required Faith and Repentance of ſuch as were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, if they had attained unto the uſe of reaſon. The Eunuch is bid look to it that he doth believe, if he will be Baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.37. yet no queſtion but children are to be prepared for the Sacrament. 2. No more was required in the Iewiſh Church, and there is no ſufficient diſproportion between the Members of the Iewiſh and the Chriſtian Church.<note place="margin">Exo. 12.4.8 Lev. 5.4.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:113862:36"/>ſhall be deſtitute of a rule, whereby all Saints ſhall take poſſeſſion in the Kingdom of God. There was ſufficient caution to provide for every Iſraelite in the promiſed Land. No Wheat muſt be pulled up with the Tares, the Tares muſt rather be tolerated. In ſome ſenſe <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſpeaks truth, <hi>Multi ſunt lupi intus, multa ſunt over foris:</hi> but it muſt not be our default, we are bound to walk by ſuch a rule as will neceſſarily receive (either in part or in whole) ſuch as are called of God, I ſay neceſſarily in an ordinary way of providence. Now that rule which requires more then is neceſſary to the weakeſt Believer, muſt needs exclude the called of God: and that rule which neceſſarily or abſolutely requires unneceſſary experiences, ſavorineſs of ſpeech, ſutableneſs of ſpirit to our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, perſwaſion of found converſion, &amp;c. ſuch is rule (I ſay) requires much more then is neceſſary or compenble to the weakeſt Believer. To require a perſwaſion in our hearts of the converſion of all that are admitted, is too much, unleſſe we can meet with a rule that will admit all Saints, and alſo afford ſuch a perſwaſion. It will contradict the rule of admiſſion, to make out apprehenſions part of the rule. Our fancies are a leaden rule, and if we are ſevere, and have no cetain rule to regulate us, we ſhall exclude the weak more often then we ſhall receive them. 4. The loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of abſolute probability that a perſon as converted, ſhould be ſatisfactory. The weakeſt Chriſtians are to be received, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and the weakeſt can hold forth no more then the leaſt degree of an abſolute probability, the ſtrongeſt can hold forth no more then the higheſt degree of probability. Again, either the higheſt or the loweſt, or ſome middle degree of probability is requiſite, the higheſt is not, and what rule is there for ſome middle degree? If it be not is our power to require a years experience for more degrees of probability, why a moneths experience? The demonſtration of the weakeſt Believer is the rule of admiſſion, if we could finde it our, not the approbation of our fancies. There is indeed a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective probability of converſion neceſſary to admiſſion, but not ſo much as an abſolute probability is all ages of the Church. We ought to judge ſuch to be Chriſtians as are admitted, and there muſt be ſome probable ground for ſuch a judgement. The rule of admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is a rule of prudence, for the excluſion of ſuch as are ignorant of the Fundamentals, or for the excluſion of ſuch as upon ſearch ſhall be found to be unregenerate by their ignorance of the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:113862:37"/>and alſo of ſuch as are ſcandalous; and yet it is a rule of charity for the reception of all new-born Babes. Charity and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence are not <hi>membra dividentiae,</hi>

A ſuſpectable converſation may as juſtly call for an inquiſitive ſcrutiny upon the conſcience (for the diſcovery of true grace) after admiſſion, as before admiſſion. 6. The practiſe of the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt confine our prudence, they were better directed and inſtructed then we are. And they expected no teſtimony, not a days experience, they could not in ſo ſhort a time make any inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or hear any perſwaſive relations. The yongeſt Converts muſt be inſtantly imbraced, therefore ſome days of experience, or teſtime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are not neceſſary. Some are ignorant, and of an arid conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and expreſſion, therefore an explicite ſavor of language is not equally requiſite in all. It is ſufficient if there be a reſpective probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in Profeſſors, if the rule be ſuch as that commonly it admits ſuch as are for the moſt part ſincere or godly, yea though we cannot finde ſuch a preciſe rule. The Apoſtolical rule was large, it did ſuffer many corrupt members to creep in, as <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks, none (as far as we read) were ever put by, yet Converts were many, yong, ignorant, rude, and converſions were ſudden and paſſionate: No marvel that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, that Hypocrites did come in with great affection to ſuch as the Apoſtles were. 7. If ample relations of the work of grace be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, then either for ſatisfaction or for edification, not for ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as hath been proved, not for edification, as theſe conſiderations following do perſwade. 1. Would it not be as profitable for all Members to come about again at certain State ſeaſons. 2. Such relations do uncover the nakedneſs of Brethren and Fathers. 3. They ſlander ſuch as are not gifted, ſuch as cannot expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in good language. 4. Pride is ſet on the ſtage in the houſe of God. 5. Hypocrites are provoked to paint and act themſelves. 6. Such relations are known to afflict the afflicted, who came to us and with us in love, and we here hide our faces from them. 7. The eloquent and ſuch as have athletick conſtitutions, carry away unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved reſpect from Countrey Chriſtians. <hi>Materiam ſuperabat opus.</hi> Hence iſſue compariſons, nay we foſter (in ſtead of preventing) ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitious partiality. 8. Yong men exalt themſelves over the Faith
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:113862:37"/>of their Ancients. 9. Some are ſent to their graves fruſtrate of their hopes, we being in a way to admit no more in many years, then were admitted by the Apoſtles in one day; much expence or waſte of time to no effect. 10. To grieve ſuch as ought to be comforted, to defame ſuch as deſerve honor, to judge one another for infirmities, is unjuſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. The Apoſtle thought it juſt to think well of all, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is not humility to honor our ſelves ungroundedly, more then others; it is not love to ſuſpect, there had need be appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent reaſon for ſuch, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. The Apoſtles were diligent and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in directing, and exhorting, and rebuking, and why are they then ſo ſilent in point of Admiſſion?

We know he entertained ſuch Diſciples as envied the Lord Chriſt, ſo open was the door of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.

There were many Baſtards or Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, that muſt never enter into the Congregation of the Myſtical Church.

The queſtion is, what the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles did viſibly come unto before they were admitted, the faces of many Converts argue that they were come but to ſome <hi>mediums</hi> between Barbariſm and ſound Chriſtianity and that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the common effuſion of the holy Ghoſt, after admiſſion by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands. 3.

The fear of perſecution did make ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion the more difficult, ſo far was it from facilitating it. <hi>Paul</hi> had not been ſhaved but for fear of perſecution, not for fear of pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It may be then retorted that there is leſs need of ſearching now then in thoſe days, becauſe we do not fear perſecution by falſe Brethren, as they did. 4. All Hypocrites might have more cauſe (all things conſidered) to joyn themſelves in thoſe times in reſpect of danger, then now they have, becauſe they could then revolt at their pleaſure, both ſafely and honorably, in reſpect of the multitude, which now is impoſſible. And there were alluring invitations of gain, maintenance, wonderful gifts, the ſociety of the Apoſtles, men admired. If the Apoſtles had made tryal of Converts before ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, it had been more conſiderable, yet the adventure of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution is common to Turks, Papiſts, Familiſts, all Heretiques, it is ordinary for men to precipitate themſelves upon death, even for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable novelties. But if there was leſs gain acquired in thoſe days, there was more loſs adventured, and gain enough to occaſion much ſuſpition of Converts, and much inquiſition in admiſſion, if it had been allowed.

                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. doth not hold it forth in point of Ordination, but is a Fundamental principle of Religion, uſed figuratively for the gift of the holy Ghoſt, which is ſignified and conferred. 1. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles diſcourſe concerned ſuch principles as were neceſſary to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution or Initiation of Converts. 2. Doctrine is added to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and Impoſition to intimate that the Doctrine of the Ordinance, or touching the Ordinance, not the Ordinance it ſelf, was intended. If the Impoſition it ſelf had been here intended, it might have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported or connotated the whole Miniſtery as an adjunct thereof; but the Doctrine of Impoſition, or touching Impoſition, is the ſame is in Ordination reſpectively, as in that extraordinary confirmation added to Baptiſm, which is the ordinary Sacrament of confirmation. The communication of the Spirit is the thing ſignified, or the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Impoſition. 3. Doctrine muſt needs be applied to the conſequent principles; by the Reſurrection, is meant the Doctrine of the Reſurrection, by the laſt Judgement, the Doctrine of the laſt judgement, and conſequently by Impoſition, is meant the Doctrine of Impoſition. 4. The order is obſervable, the gift of the holy Ghoſt, or Impoſition, as an explicative adjunct of Baptiſm, juſtly followeth the principle of Baptiſm (the Doctrine of Sanctification and Juſtification by ſaith being contained therein) becauſe the ſpirit in way of a ſecond act, is promiſed to ſeal the Doctrine of Baptiſm, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.14, 15. <hi>He ſhall Baptize you with the holy Ghoſt, Joh.</hi> 1. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. 5. It is anſwerable to the promiſe of the holy Ghoſt, thereof <hi>Peter</hi> Preached in laying the foundation of converſion, according to that place but now alleaged. The gift ſealed Faith, and ſignified that the Spirit was the Author, even of Faith and of all Grace, unto perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. 6. Faith and Repentance, perſeverance in Grace, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Faith (ſignified in Baptiſm) the Reſurrection and the laſt Judgement, are all Fundamental principles of Religion, not only common principles of Chriſtian Profeſſion: All the other are Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental principles, therefore Impoſition is alſo, in probability. 7. It is Interpreted in the next Verſes, 4, and 5. Illumination an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to Repentance, the taſte of the heavenly gift to Faith, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the holy Ghoſt to the Doctrine of Baptiſm and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:113862:40"/>the taſting of the good Word of God to the Reſurrection, &amp;c. 8. The proſecution of the diſcourſe doth argue it. Impoſition is made a principle, from which it was neceſſary an Apoſtate ſhould fall, if finally. But it is not neceſſary, that one ſhould be inſtructed touching the Office of the Miniſtery: One may be ſaved, and yet be ignorant in the point of Ordination, and one may fall away finally, though ignorant in this reſpect. The knowledge indeed (or ſome participation) of the gift of the holy Ghoſt, is neceſſary as an ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, and the ſin of Apoſtacy is moſt properly called the ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the holy Ghoſt, as being againſt convictions by the holy Ghoſt.<note n="(a)" place="margin">The ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt is againſt ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, or ſome participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the holy Ghoſt</note> 9. If we ſhould underſtand the Doctrine of the Miniſtery by Impoſition, then we muſt exclude the Adminiſtration of Baptiſm in the principle of Baptiſm, becauſe Baptiſm under this conſideration belongeth unto the Miniſtery, and therefore cannot (except it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Doctrine of Baptiſm only) be a diſtinct principle from Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands. And if we ſhall make Baptiſm it ſelf, together with the Doctrine which it holds forth, a diſtinct principle, and the Doctrine of Impoſition, together with the Adminiſtration of it, in Ordination, another diſtinct principle, to what principle ſhall we refer the Sacrament of the Lords Supper? 10. It is known how commonly Interpreters do apply this Impoſition of hands to confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which was wont in Primitive times (even after the Apoſtles days) to be nothing elſe but Impoſition of hands,<note place="margin">Ezek. 1.3. &amp; 3.1.</note> and a concomitant to Baptiſm. The gift of the Spirit is a great and Fundamental princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Religion, and therefore Impofition was uſed for a ſymbol of Gods aſſiſting hand (the hand of the Lord was with them, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.23.) in theſe extraordinary times: And Impoſition being a ſymbol of that great principle, the Apoſtle figuratively expreſſeth the ſymbol, and implieth the gift. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> commendeth Impoſition and Anointing with Oyl alſo for the healing of the ſick, becauſe they were concomitants at that time of that extraordinary gift: But now there is cauſe to lay by both (as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> diſcourſeth in point of Confirmation) becauſe the gift ceaſeth. 'Tis obſervable that <hi>Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> alſo exclude both Baptiſm and Impoſition out of the number of principles here intended. Both Sanctification or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in Sanctification and Iuſtification are ſeated in Baptiſm: And therefore we are Baptized with the Spirit of Chriſt, as well as with the Blood of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. Baptiſm doth ſignifie the communication of the Spirit, as well as Impoſition; the water
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:113862:41"/>doth ſignifie the Spirit of Chriſt as well as the Blood of Chriſt; but Impoſition did ſignifie that part of Baptiſm more directly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily, while there was an extraordinary effuſion of the Spirit.</p>

                  </note> The practiſe of Impoſition in the Apoſtles days is not prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential to us, becauſe it was obſerved only by extraordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or at leaſt by extraordinary revelation in point of Ordination. Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and extraordinary Presbyters, are only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded to have uſed this Rite in the New Teſtament. In the Old Teſtament <hi>Jacob</hi> in bleſſing impoſed hands, <hi>Moſes</hi> in Ordaining <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> impoſed hands, but both of them by ſpecial revelation, and an extraordinary men.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:113862:41"/>may be this ſign, together with many other, commend <hi>Paul</hi> to the Church as an Apoſtle of Chriſt, but it doth not follow that he was here Ordained to be an Apoſtle. 5. Were theſe Elders ordinary or extrardinary, did they Ordain them or not Ordain them? they were warranted to impoſe hands by ſpecial revelation. Separate me <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> (ſaith the Spirit) unto the work which I have called them unto, tis not expreſſed what work it was.</p>

                  </note> that it is not now to be appropriated to Ordination, in caſe it ought to be reſerved. If we muſt remove Impoſition from Converts, from prayers for the ſick, if from any, why not from all? The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary gift ceaſeth in reſpect of Ordination, as well as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the other Adminiſtrations, the ordinary gift remains equally in all.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was not of this uſe in the conſecration of Prieſts and Levites. 2. It is not of this uſe in the Ordination of Deacons: why ſhould it ſignifie any otherwiſe in the Ordination of Elders then in the Ordination of Deacons? 3. In Confirmations, in Benedictions, in Prayers for the Sick it ſignified directly but the gift of the Spirit. <hi>Calvin</hi> only maketh it a geſture of Prayer, and a ſign of approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 4. It is manifeſt that in all other Adminiſtrations it was uſed by the Apoſtles as connatural to the extraordinary gift of the Spirit. The common gift of the Spirit under the Goſpel (the Goſpel being the miniſtration of the Spirit comparatively) might admit ſuch an extraordinary ſymbol, but why only in Ordination?<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.8.</note> Yet it ſeemeth rather proper to the extraordinary gift, and power of extrabrdinary perſons. The extraordinary effects did countenance ſuch ſolemnities of expreſſion in ſuch perſons. <hi>Eliah</hi> might pray with his head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his legs, becauſe he could do obſervable wonders by prayer. An extraordinary Rite or adjunct in prayer or bleſſing, is proper to an extraordinary prayer, and to an extraordinary bleſſing. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Reformed Churches do generally diminiſh the uſe of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands: The omiſſion of it is rather alowed then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by <hi>Aretius.</hi> The right hand of fellowſhip was never in uſe as an Eccleſiaſtical Rite, according to all the Interpreters that I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with: It was a Civil cuſtom, and <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 2. alludes to it, and where an Ancient Father uſeth the phraſe, he may well be

As for Impoſition, it is acknowledged only to be an ornament or adjunct (not any eſſential part of the Sacrament of orders) by many great ones amongſt the Papiſts, and ſo argued in the Councel of <hi>Trent.</hi> If we make Impoſition a ſacred Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Ordination, then we muſt put Religion in it, and uſe it as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, <hi>neceſſitate praecepti.</hi>

The long continuance in ſuch open impiety, to the out-facing of the Church and the World con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the ſame,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.</note> might be equivalent to impenitency manifeſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt many admonitions in a Church way.

There is ſome appearance that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had executed ſome Diſcipline, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this determination of the Apoſtle; becauſe the Apoſtle had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly forbid them by writing to hold communion with Fornicators. It were ſtrange the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſhould ſo neglect the Apoſtles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, as not to obſerve ſuch a Fornicator as this was; ſurely they did Diſcipline him, though they came ſhort of manifeſting juſt indignation againſt him by Excommunication.</p>

                  </note> which are not fundamentally defective, neither in Doctrine or Maners, in Hereſie or Prophaneneſs. 1. It is contrary to the Doctrine and Practiſe both of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Chriſt bids his Diſciples hear the Scribes and Phariſees; he frequented the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues himſelf, together with his Diſciples, yet how corrupt was the Iewiſh Church both in Doctrine and Maners, both in Officers and Adminiſtrations? In <hi>Corinth, Galatia, Thyatira, Pergamos,</hi> there is no agitation, no motion of ſeparation, of ſequeſtration, but Exhortations to Peace and Unity. It was lawful to follow the Ark when <hi>David</hi> put it in the new Cart, it was lawful to communicate with the corrupt Prieſts in the Temple, <hi>Go ſhew thy ſelf to the Prieſt, Matth.</hi> 8.4. The feaſt of Tabernacles was not celebrated exactly, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3.4. for <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 8.17. it is ſaid, <hi>That it had not been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſo exactly from the days of Joſhuah.</hi> It is likely it was obſerved in <hi>Davids</hi> time, and in the times of other good Kings, but was it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful for any to be preſent at the celebration of it becauſe of defects? 2. If we may ſeparate for a nonfundamental defect, if for any one, why not for every one? If from a Prayer becauſe it is read by a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in the Church, why not for any other adjunct of Error? A Prayer ſavoring of Faith and Obedience is eſſentially good. Reading, repeating, incongruous petitions in reſpect of matter or form exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, are but adjuncts, or accidental to Prayer. Where ſhall we make a ſtand or ſubſiſtence, if not in Fundamental defects? What Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations of man is free from all defects in reſpect of adjuncts or circumſtances? 3. We are not to reject <hi>in toto</hi> or <hi>in tanto,</hi> otherwiſe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:113862:44"/>then Chriſt doth reject; but Chriſt doth reject none totally for cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial defects. In this caſe non-communication is at leaſt a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive Excommunication and an exceſſive infliction of evil. 4. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der requires obſtinacy even in Fundamental defects, unto all parts of peremptory Excommunication; and an abſolute ſeparation is a part of ſuch an Excommunication, it being with reference to thoſe which are within; it is neceſſary to the Excommunication of Members in particular, much more to the Excommunication of Churches. 5. It is not allowed as an act of Authority, or of Charity. 1. Not as an act of Authority, a private perſon is ſubject, Children may not Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline their Parents; but thus to ſeparate in way of Authority or Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, were a Diſciplining not only of the Church, but of Chriſt himſelf, who maintaineth communion with the Church while the foundation ſtandeth. 2. Not as an act of charity to the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not for edification: It is not orderly circumſtantiated, but ſo, as that it rather provokes then edifies.

Such as are Antichriſtian, being badges of falſe, Religion, and in ſtate Idolothy tors, do not only weaken, but alſo pollute and defile the Worſhip of God; appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Abomination never allowed in Gods Worſhip. 3.

The example of Chriſt and the Saints in Scripture doth oppoſe all active obedience to mans Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in the Worſhip of God. To inſtance in kneeling at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, it is unnatural to a table Prayer, to the Inſtitution of the feaſt, though it be not a direct Inſtitution of it ſelf. Chriſt applieth and preſſeth ſitting at Table (<hi>Luke</hi> 22.) as ſignificant, at leaſt connaturally with the feaſt it ſelf, it being conna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to the nature of the feaſt.

And if the Table at the inſtant of the Sacrament be ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant, why not ſitting at the Table? Reſt is frequently an Emblem of our bliſs in the kingdom of God, and ſitting down in the Kingdom of God (in Scripture phraſe) is Analogical thereunto,<note place="margin">Mat. 8.11.

When there appears no natural occaſion of alteration, nay when it appears that the practiſe of our Lord was moſt conſonant na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally to his Inſtitution.

Azorius</hi> obſerveth a meetneſſe in acknowledging of Gods works, by the firſt fruits of our works. The ſame grounds that were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable for the firſt obſervation of the ſeventh day, do laſt to the end of the World. Time was from the beginning divided by weeks, and the ſeventh day was alſo anciently obſerved amongſt the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, it was <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> as <hi>Philo</hi> calleth it. It is evident that the ſeventh day was not inſtituted only by way of anticipation or deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for time future. The reaſon of the obſervation of the ſeventh day was contemporary to the Inſtitution of it. For it was Inſtituted with reſpect to Gods ending of his works. And the form of the fourth Commandement doth ſhew, that it was to be celebrated at the firſt Inſtitution, becauſe it is Inſtituted with reverence to Gods ending of his works. 2. It was Inſtituted before the Revelation of Chriſt, and therefore had ſomething in it which was not to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed with ſuch Ceremonies, as had only relation unto Chriſt. It was at firſt <hi>liberae inſtitutionis,</hi> but it is not now <hi>liberae obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis,</hi> becauſe it was Inſtituted in the beginning. <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed at the ſame time, it may well be the Sabbath. The Chalde Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſt on the 92. <hi>Pſal.</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Adam</hi> indicted it for the celebration of the Sabbath. The Jews may neglect this day in <hi>Egypt</hi> for fear of <hi>Pharoah:</hi> but yet it ſeemeth (by <hi>Exod.</hi> 16) that it was not unknown to the Jews. It is poſſible there may be a natural equity in a ſeventh day of Worſhip, which is unſcrutable in reſpect of us. One ſaith well, that men and Angels could not deviſe ſo juſt a time for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of the Sabbath as of a former Ordinance, when he Inſtituted the gathering of Manna; and God confirmeth it by the miraculous detention of Manna upon that day. 3. It was eſtated in the Moral Law, written with the finger of God, alwayes repeated with the other Commandements, and eſtabliſhed with all the ſolemnities of Gods preſence on the Mount. 4. The breach of this Commandement is expreſſely puniſhed by the Judicial Law: The breach of a meer ceremony is not expreſſely puniſhable in the Judicials of <hi>Moſes.</hi> 5. If a ſet and fixed time for Worſhip be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and God muſt appoint this time, and there be no other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God but this, then this muſt needs be ſo Moral, as to continue in force. There is a neceſſity, that the Church ſhould have
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:113862:47"/>a ſet time for Worſhip, becauſe it was neceſſary for <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of Innocency, and becauſe it is proportionately convenient with a ſet place. What that, our experience is as good as a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand witneſſes. The neceſſity of Gods immediate deſignation of a ſet time, is argued from Gods undertaking of it under the Law. The ſet times of Worſhip (for perpetuity) were all immediately appointed and expreſſed by God. 2. From Gods Inſtituting a ſet time to <hi>Adam. Adam</hi> was more wiſe to chuſe a juſt time then we are. 3. From Gods challenging this prerogative, in all conſtant or ſtanding Ordinances of Worſhip. 4. From experienced danger of ſuperſtition in times of our own election. 5. From the example of the godly in the pureſt times of Worſhip. In latter times it hath been attempted to change times and Laws, but not allowed. Antichriſt is brought in by <hi>Daniel</hi> as thinking he ſhould prevail in his inſolent preſumptions, againſt the Ordinances of God, even in reſpect of changing times, <hi>Daniel</hi> 7.25.</p>

                  </note> and as it was ſignificative of Chriſts reſting in his grave, it is generally eſteemed Ceremonial. The Moſaical acceſſion of ſignification was buried with other Ceremonies in the grave of Chriſt: And that it is not naturally Moral, theſe following conſiderations do argue, 1. The ſtrength of natural reaſon is not by any means able to demonſtrat that a ſeventh day is more obſervable for Worſhip then another naturally. 2. It was given to <hi>Adam</hi> by revelation, not ingraven in his heart by Creation as the natural Law was. 3. The Moral reaſons ſpecified are not neceſſary but Arbitrary. 4. Other ſevens of time in the ſeaſts were Arbitrary, and the reaſons of their Inſtitution of like nature. The deliverance out of <hi>Egypt</hi> might have beſpoken a perpetual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance in a Feaſt of Paſſover amongſt the Jews. 5. At leaſt, a particular ſeventh is not naturally Moral: The firſt ſeventh was not, becauſe it is not now, the preſent ſeventh is not, becauſe it was not in the beginning. Why ſhould a ſeventh day be naturally more holy then a ſeventh week, moneth or year? 6. Our Saviour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth it but to a Ceremony,<note place="margin">Mark 2.</note> as being alterable and ſubordinate to the natural Law. 7. This particular time is no more Moral then a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular place. The obſervation of <hi>Zanchi</hi> and others (that it is the Sabbath, not the ſeventh day from the Creation, which is ſpecified in the fourth Commandment) may not be altogether ſound, for that very ſeventh day from the Creation is expreſſed in the body of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:113862:48"/>the Commandment. Something was intederted in the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and alſo in the fifth, that concerneth the people of God only before the Law. The preface to all the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in ſome reſpect, only concerneth the people of the Iews.</p>

                  </note> in the firſt Inſtitution of the Sabath, by way of anticipation. The ſeals of the Covenant, the tree of Wiſdom, and the tree of Life, were (in part) typical, in reference to Chriſt and the Church, though but tranſiently and in the way of anticipation. Chriſt was not revealed when thoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments were Inſtituted, when <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were created, yet they were all types of Chriſt and the Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.29. The Wedding day of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> was the Sabbath, and did juſtly ſignifie the wedding of the lamb, when the whole work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption ſhall be finiſhed in point of application, as it is already in point of ſatisfaction. The whole Garden, the Soveraignty of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> over all Creatures, the Rivers that watered the Garden, the riches thereof,<note place="margin">Rev. 21.</note> the gold and precious ſtones, all type out the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Paradiſe both of Grace and Glory, in the way of anticipation. <hi>Pererius</hi> hath collected out of <hi>Hugo de vict.</hi> an elegant type of the new Creation in all the works of the ſix dayes, ſo that the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath may juſtly come in thereupon, to ſignifie the reſt of Chriſt and of the Church after that their work is ended. Thus the reſt of Chriſt in his grave may be Antitypical to Gods reſting on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, after that Chriſt had finiſhed the work of ſatifaction on the Croſſe. Thus the reſt of the Goſpel may be Antitypical to Gods reſting on the Sabbath, Chriſt had ended his work under the Law.

                  </note> and the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after is an application of the Sabbath; but the beginning of holy time is the morning light. 1. The firſt day in <hi>Geneſis</hi> 1. began with morning light. 1. God called the light day, and the darkneſs night, therefore light and darkneſs together is not the day, but the light as diſtinguiſhed from the night or darkneſs. Day in the firſt words of the Text, is taken for the time of light, therefore it is ſo taken (one would think) in the next words immediatly following. When it is ſaid that morning and evening, or evening and morning were the firſt day, it ſeems not congruous to ſay that the day and the night were the firſt day. 2.<note place="margin">Gen 24.63 Exo. 19.18. Lev. 11.24.</note> Evening is generally taken for the later part of the day by <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf. The Sacrifices of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were Sacrifices of the ſame day. The evening which was to be obſerved in the day of expiation, before the tenth day, is referred to the ninth day, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.32. 3. The Hebrew word uſed by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> is not naturally appliable to the night, becauſe it ſignifies a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of light and darkneſs in the notation of it. <hi>Verba ſunt nota re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi> 4. It ſeems thus to be underſtood, from the fourth day, the Sun is made the rule and meaſure of the day. The ſpace of darkneſs before that the light was created in unknown, and the time of light is a certain principle of computation. 5. The Jews began their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural day with light.<note place="margin">Gen. 7.10. Exod. 24. Deut. 9.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> is wont to place the day before the night; and ſo it is to be obſerved in the Sabbath Pſalms, it calls for praiſe in the day, and in the night alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. The Sun is made the meaſure of the day at diſtinguiſhed from the night, and is alſo ſet before the night, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.16. A ſecond general Argument is taken from the nature of the Sabbath, as it was ſignificative it had refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the time of light wherein men uſe to work, and wherein we ſhall enjoy God for ever. The time of light in both Hemiſphaeres might be comprehended, but <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks according to the vulgar. 3. God ended the ſixth days work in the ſixth days night, according to that Hemiſphaere wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was created; and conſequently the ſeventh day, or the ſeventh part of time, which was Sanctified, began with morning light. 4. God Sanctified but the ſeventh day, and yet if both Hemiſphaeres ſhould begin their Sabbath from the evening of both Hemiſphaeres, there ſhould be a day and an half
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:113862:50"/>Sanctified, becauſe the ſecond evening begins twelve hours after the firſt. 5. Foraſmuch as <hi>Moſes</hi> did underſtand by day (and that in the ſame narration) the time of light, it argues that the Sabbath day was obſerved correſpondently. 6. The Reſurrection of Chriſt is the meaſure of obſerving the Lords day, as the Jews going out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> by night was the meaſure of the Feaſt of the Paſsover, and the Lord roſe about the break of day, <gap reason="foreign">

In <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.16. it is certain that the diſtinct time of light is called day, and if it were ſo certain that the night were at any time meant by evening (in the ſame Chapter) then one might be put to the other.

It is preſſed home in the Inſtitution of the Paſsover,<note place="margin">Lev. 23.3.6.</note> and of the day of expiation, but never intimated when the weekly Sabbath is ſpoken of. 3. One of the Sabbaths is not intended, and there is no more reaſon for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding of the weekly Sabbath in that injunction. The Jews were to recken on the morning of the Sabbath of the Paſsover, to the morning after ſeven Sabbaths, fifty days, for the celebration of the feaſt of firſt fruits, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.15.16. The reaſon of obſerving the Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over in the evening is expreſſed, and is proper thereto. The faſt doth properly take in the night, becauſe it did beſt ſute a time of affliction, that muſt precede the morning of victory and conſolation, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.16. The evening (ſaith <hi>Heſychius</hi>) ſignified <hi>tempora ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpertina, in quibus dominus advenis.</hi> The Rabbins record that none were to work on the evening of the ordinary Sabbath, but yet not upon pain of ſcourging, or any civil puniſhment, as it was to work on the evening of the Paſsover. That act of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in ſhutting the gates, was nothing but a juſt preparation for the Sabbath. It
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:113862:50"/>is expreſſed that the gates were ſhut before the Sabbath, the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the Sabbath, not the evening of the Sabbath. 4.

                  </note> Day is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly taken for the time of light in Scripture phraſe. Day is day, and night is night. The Iews were wont to divide the time of light into twelve hours, and counted it their day. It is true, a natural day with reference to the whole circuit of the Sun in both Hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaeres, conſiſteth of twenty four hours: With reference to one Hemiſphaere, <hi>dies Civilis</hi> (as we ſpeak) conſiſteth of twelve hours, but the <hi>Romans</hi> ſo called their day when it took in the night alſo. In the computation of time we call that a day which takes in the night alſo, but than we ſpeak with reference to the natural day of the whole world, not to the natural day of one Hemiſphaere. 2. The ſeventh day ſignified the lightſome day of Heaven, where there is no night. And it was appointed to ſignifie the time of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which we call an artificial day. 3. Elſe a day and a half ſhould be ſanctified. Part of the eighth day is obſerved by the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:113862:51"/>if night and day alſo be obſerved. The gaining and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of time by navigation, is dependent on an extraordinary or unuſual motion of a two or three: But the eighth day in part, ſhall be obſerved by half the world ordinarily or conſtantly, and that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Gods Inſtitution, if day and night together, muſt be counted holy. 4. How do we ſanctifie time by ſleeping? Why may it not be as good to ſet up an work, as to be a bed and ſleep, except it be for preparation? 5. It is ſutable to the firſt Inſtitution by <hi>Moſet,</hi> To morrow (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi>) is the Sabbath of reſt.<note place="margin">Exo. 16.23.</note> The Manna which ſignified Chriſt, fell in the morning, becauſe the time of grace is repreſented by the time of light. The Quailes, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified fleſhly, bodily and external ſervices came in the evening, the time of darkneſſe. Thus the Jews and Papiſts have exceſſively luſted after, and delighted in fleſhly ſervices, until their Worſhip ſtank both before God and men. The Iews ended their Sabbath in the evening, but what teſtimony is there to prove that it was their duty, to begin their Sabbath in the evening as part of holy time? Many do now ſuppoſe that the Iews began their natural day, or rather their Civil day (if we ſpeak like the <hi>Romans</hi>) in the evening. They ſay it was Gods Inſtitution, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. but there is no appearance of any Inſtitution for the beginning of ordinary time: and that Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution rather argueth, that ordinarily, the day was not begun in the evening. Some obſerve that it was only the beginning of their religious dayes. It was anciently concluded that the Iews began their day with the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> in the morning, and it is anſwerable to the current of Scripture. Many Fathers and Schoolmen do peremptorily hold, that the firſt day began with the light, and therefore underſtand by evening the end of light, by morning the end of darkneſſe, and all do not conceive that day doth there take in the night.</p>

               <p>We are to make preparation for the due celebration of the Lords day. 1.

We are to prepare our ſelves to feaſt on the Paſsover by dreſſing of the Lamb, for the Feaſt of firſt fruits, by conſidering the goodneſſe of God from the time of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to Thankſgiving, for the feaſt of Tabernacles, by perfecting mortification, as on the day of expiation.

It is called the Sabbath of the Lord, and the Lords day. 4. The Lord is our preſident in obſerving this day, he reſted himſelf. 5. It is a day of refreſhing, it upholds all the Ordinances of our edification, a day that is bleſſed of the Lord. All theſe particulars require us to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this day as unto the Lord, that we might habituate our ſelves to godlines. We ſhould ſhew our love to the Lord in ſhewing for whom we work on this day, and ſhew that we make God our delight, by making this day our delight. Thoſe that eat the Paſsover muſt make it their great buſineſſe, in purpoſe and reſolution to prepare themſelves for the enjoying of Chriſt; thoſe that feaſt it before the Lord in the Feaſt of firſt fruits, muſt make it their great buſineſſe to bring forth fruits unto God; thoſe that enjoy the Feaſt of Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, muſt make it their great buſineſſe to mortifie the fleſh, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect their humiliation. If all leaven be purged out, the bitter hearbs of affliction ſhall but acuate the appetites, and cauſe us to reliſh the Lamb that is killed for us the better. The leaven of ſin made <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> heart feel the leaven of grief, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.21. It is in the original, My heart was leavened with grief. The cakes of the ſhew-bread were renewed every Lords day; if we renew our ſelves in preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, God wil not be wanting to renew us by confirmations of his grace towards us. New cakes are vigorous and pleaſant, ſo are ſuch as do dreſſe themſelves anew, to appear before the Lord on his high days. He that works the ſix days for God, ſhall reſt the ſeventh day in God. <hi>Hanc feſtivitatem nemo celebrare, qui non operatus eſt bona spera &amp; Deo dignae, poteſt: Heſychius.</hi>
